# Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History

| **Change Date** | **Modified Sections** | **Rationale** |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| 2025-10-26      | 3.1 (Feed & Discover), 3.4 (Feed use case), 4.3, 4.4 | **Feed Toggle Redesign & Quote System Clarification**: (1) Feed screen now uses compact floating pill toggles for "Friends" vs "My Activities", centered above the list so content flows beneath. Added documentation for new FAB-style segmented controls and adjusted feed padding to avoid overlap. (2) Clarified Discover featured quote sourcing: The app attempts to fetch quotes from the TMDB tagline service via `/api/quotes` (which now returns TMDB taglines rather than Wikiquote data) and caches successful responses. When the API has no tagline or the request fails, the app falls back to a local offline catalog of ~1,050 curated movie-themed taglines with deterministic daily rotation. Updated documentation to accurately reflect the hybrid approach. |
| 2025-10-25      | 3.1 (Feed), 3.4 (Feed use cases), 4.1 (UserFeed interfaces), 4.2 (Database), Design notes | **Feed Interaction Features - Likes and Comments**: Added social engagement features to feed activities. (1) Backend: Created Like and Comment models with MongoDB schemas, compound indexes for performance (userId+activityId unique for likes, activityId+createdAt for comments). Added endpoints: POST/DELETE /api/feed/:activityId/like for liking/unliking, GET/POST /api/feed/:activityId/comments for viewing/adding comments (500 char limit). Updated GET /api/feed to include likeCount, commentCount, and isLikedByUser fields. (2) Frontend: Updated FeedActivity model with new fields, added like/unlike toggle with optimistic UI updates, created CommentBottomSheet component for viewing and posting comments. Feed cards now display thumbs up icon (filled when liked) and comment bubble icon with counts. Comment sheet shows all comments with user avatars, timestamps, and inline comment input field. (3) UI: Like button shows primary color when liked, comment count updates in real-time after posting. |
| 2025-10-25      | 3.1 (UI consistency), Design notes | **Star Rating Display Standardization**: Replaced text-based ratings ("★ 8.4") with consistent 5-star visual display across entire app using StarRating component. (1) Display format: Year + 5 stars with partial fill + rating number (e.g., "2023 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.4"). TMDB 0-10 scale converted to 0-5 stars, gold filled stars (#FFD700), 14dp star size, 8dp spacing. (2) Updated screens: Profile watchlist preview, Friends profile watchlist, Feed activity cards, Feed movie detail bottom sheet, Watchlist screen, all movie detail sheets. (3) Fixed FriendProfileScreen top banner overflow: added maxLines=1 and ellipsis to prevent wide banner with long friend names. Consistent format now matches Discover, Ranking, and Recommendation screens. |
| 2025-10-25      | 3.1 (Discover), 4.3 (External modules), 4.4 (Backend frameworks), UI consistency | **Featured Movie Quote Card & UI Consistency Improvements**: (1) Fixed quote card bug on Discover page: removed plot description fallback that was incorrectly showing movie summaries as "quotes". Expanded curated quote database from ~120 to 575+ movies (5x increase) covering all major genres, franchises, and eras. Increased Wikiquote API timeout from 3.5s to 6s for better real quote fetching. Added smart movie-themed fallback messages. (2) Standardized "add to ranking" behavior across all screens (Ranking, Feed, Discover/Recommendation, Friends, Watchlist): bottom sheets now close on success/error, feedback messages display at top of screen overlaying current page, auto-dismiss after 4 seconds. Added RankingEvent.Error type for proper error handling. (3) Backend: Added cheerio library for Wikiquote HTML scraping, fixed TypeScript compilation errors. |
| 2025-10-24      | 4.1 (UserManager), 4.3 (External modules), 4.4 (Backend/Frontend frameworks) | **Firebase Cloud Messaging Implementation**: Implemented push notifications for real-time user engagement. (1) Backend: Added FCM token registration endpoint (POST /api/users/fcm-token), integrated firebase-admin SDK for sending notifications, extended User model with fcmToken field, integrated notifications into feed activity creation and friend request flows. (2) Frontend: Added Firebase Cloud Messaging SDK (BOM 33.7.0), implemented MovieTierFirebaseMessagingService for receiving notifications, created two notification channels (feed_updates and friend_requests), automatic token registration on app startup and refresh, notification permission handling for Android 13+. (3) Notifications sent for: friend ranks new movie, incoming friend request, friend request accepted. Documentation includes setup guide in documentation/FCM_SETUP.md. |
| 2025-10-24      | 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7 | **M3 Milestone Completion**: (1) Section 3.4: Added watchlist use cases (7 cases: add, view, remove, sort, ranking integration, watch providers, friend watchlist). (2) Section 3.5: Replaced authentication with "Use Case 6: ADD MOVIE TO WATCHLIST" (9-step scenario, 4 failure cases). (3) Section 4.1: Component interfaces with HTTP/REST endpoints (UserManager, FriendManager, MovieListsManager, UserFeed, WatchlistManager) and internal service interfaces. (4) Section 4.4: Frameworks/libraries documentation (Backend: Express.js, Mongoose, google-auth-library, jsonwebtoken, axios, TypeScript, Jest; Frontend: Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Retrofit, Coil, Kotlin Coroutines) with versions. (5) Section 4.6: Sequence diagram structure for 5 major use cases. (6) Section 4.7: NFR implementation (ranking performance, usability constraints). |
| 2025-10-24      | 3.1 (Discover), 3.4 (Recommendation use case), 4.3 (External modules), Design notes | Added in-app trailer playback: Movie detail sheets on Discover page now include a play button overlay on the poster when a trailer is available. Clicking the play button opens the trailer in a 9:16 popup window using WebView to load the full YouTube mobile page. The popup includes a close button and supports fullscreen toggling. Backend endpoint `/api/movies/:movieId/videos` fetches trailer information from TMDB API. Provides seamless in-app viewing without leaving the app. |
| 2025-10-24      | 3.1 (Discover), 3.4 (Recommendation use case) | Added "Add to Ranking" functionality from Discover page: Users can now add movies to their rankings directly from the Discover page movie detail sheet. Clicking the "Add to Ranking" button triggers the interactive comparison flow on the same page (same UX as the ranking screen). No navigation required - the entire ranking process happens inline on the Discover page. |
| 2025-10-24      | 3.1 (Ranking UI), Design notes | Redesigned ranking list actions UI: Tap any ranking card to open a Material Design 3 modal bottom sheet with action options. Sheet displays movie title and two actions: "Rerank" (with description "Compare and adjust position") and "Delete from Rankings" (with error color styling). Delete action requires confirmation dialog. Clean, intuitive, and follows Android design patterns. |
| 2025-10-24      | 3.1 (Discover/Recommendation), 3.4 (Recommendation use case), Navigation order | Added trending movies feature: When users have no ranked movies, the Discover page now displays trending movies from TMDB instead of an empty state. Backend endpoint `/api/recommendations/trending` fetches weekly trending movies. Navigation order changed to: Discover, Ranking, Feed, Friends, Profile (Discover is now the first tab and default landing page after authentication). |
| 2025-10-23      | 3.1 (Profile editing), 3.4 (Edit profile use case), 4.3 (External modules) | Added profile editing feature and corrected documentation: Users can edit display name via PUT /api/users/profile. Profile pictures are automatically sourced from Google account during sign-up and stored in profileImageUrl field (not uploaded separately). Profile data persists locally in DataStore. Removed incorrect MinIO references from External Modules section. |
| 2025-10-23      | 3.1 (Recommendation refresh), 3.4 (Recommendation use case) | Added personalized recommendation algorithm to Discover page. Algorithm analyzes user preferences from ranked movies (genres, languages, quality threshold), fetches similar/recommended movies from TMDB for top 30% of ranked movies, scores candidates based on genre matching, language preference, vote average, and recency, then adds random noise (±5) to scores to provide variety across refreshes. Returns top 20 recommendations. |
| 2025-10-23      | 3.1 (Watchlist synchronization) | Added automatic watchlist-ranking synchronization: movies are now removed from watchlist when added to rankings, ensuring watchlist only contains unwatched movies. |
| 2025-10-22      | 3.1, 3.4, Design notes | Ranking UX: search shows posters and top actors; ranking list shows poster, year, star rating, actors, and overview; year+rating on one line; rank chip above poster. Backend adds movie details and delete‑rank endpoints. |
| 2025-10-22      | 3.1 (Watchlist) | Watchlist improvements: added sorting (date added asc/desc, rating asc/desc) and display of year + star rating on each item. |
| 2025-10-20      | 3.1, 3.4, Design notes | Added "Where to Watch" feature with refinements: Feed detail bottom sheet, Watchlist items, and Friend Profile watchlist fetch TMDB watch providers (country from device locale with CA fallback) and open the TMDB watch link. Feed preview shows inline availability (top 4 platforms with " …" if more). Availability text uses grey on-surface-variant tone. Added on-device caching (DataStore, 6h TTL) for provider results to reduce API calls. |
| 2025-10-15      | 3.1 (Feed notes + Watchlist), 3.4 (Feed detail + Watchlist), Design notes | Documented Feed enhancements (TMDB description, PST yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm timestamps, card layout), Ranking add via TMDB search, added Watchlist feature (add from feed detail, Profile preview + View All, friend watchlist view), and UI feedback notes. |
| 2025-10-14      | 3.1, 3.4 (Manage Friend), Design notes | Implemented and finalized Friends feature: send/accept/reject/cancel requests, remove friend, search by name/email, outgoing requests visible (top) and cancellable, real-time SSE with reconnection/backoff, and in-app feedback messages. |

## 2. Project Description

MovieTier is a social movie companion app that makes discovering, ranking, and sharing films fun and interactive. On this app, users can login and see what movie their friends have currently rated, themselves can rate a new movie, and get a list of recommended movies based on the movies they have recommended.
In this app instead of giving out boring stars to rate a movie, the user decides which movie they liked more in a head-to-head matchup (comparing the new movie to a movie they have previously ranked), and then the app calculates the rank of the movie automatically . Over time, their personal tier list is built automatically, reflecting their true taste in cinema.

--- 

## 3. Requirements Specification

### **3.1. List of Features**

1. Authentication - There will be a google login/auth page that will allow users to sign up or sign into their account. A user can also delete their account.
   - Profile Editing: Users can edit their display name from the Profile screen via PUT /api/users/profile. Profile pictures are sourced from the user's Google account during sign-up and stored in the profileImageUrl field. All profile data persists locally in DataStore.
2. Manage Friends - The user can send friend requests (by email or by searching name/email), accept/reject incoming requests, view pending requests, and remove existing friends. Real-time notifications are delivered when a request is received or handled.
3. Feed - A user gets real time updates of their friends activities on their feed. Users get live notification whenever a friend ranks a new movie. Feed contains all friend activities (sorted in reverse chronological order) which include the movie name, ranking, friend name, and movie banner of the friends ranking. Feed activity cards display year and 5-star rating (with partial star fill, gold color #FFD700, 14dp size, 8dp spacing) for each movie. Movie detail sheets opened from Feed also use the same consistent 5-star rating format.
   - Floating Filter Toggles: Centered pill-shaped floating action buttons let users switch between "Friends" and "My Activities" views. The toggles hover above the list with subtle elevation, and the feed adds extra bottom padding so content never hides behind them.
   - Social Interactions: Users can like and comment on friend activities. Feed cards display thumbs up icon (filled with primary color when liked by user) and comment icon with counts. Tapping the like button toggles the like status with optimistic UI updates. Tapping the comment button opens a bottom sheet showing all comments with user avatars, names, timestamps, and an inline text field for adding new comments (500 character limit). Like and comment counts update in real-time. 
4. Ranked Movie List - Users will be able to generate a ranked list of movies they have seen. They can search for movies, add movies, and then rank the movie, based on comparison between previously ranked movies.  The app will then assign a final ranking to the movie based on the comparison done by the user.
   - Search results include posters (2:3) and a subtitle with year + up to 3 actors.
   - Ranking list entries show rank chip, poster, year and 5-star rating display on one line (e.g., "2023 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.4" with partial star fill based on TMDB rating converted from 0-10 to 0-5 scale), top actors, and a short overview. Star rating uses gold color (#FFD700), 14dp star size, and 8dp spacing.
   - Action sheet: Tap any ranking card to open a modal bottom sheet with action options (Rerank and Delete from Rankings). Delete action requires confirmation.


5. Discover (Recommendation) - Based on users top movies rankings there will be a recommended list of movies that the user can watch. The recommendation list will be generated based on the top movies on the users tiered list. The list will exclude all the movies which are already ranked by the user. Each movie in the list will contain the movie name, movie banner, and movie duration. Movie detail sheets display year and 5-star rating (with partial star fill, gold color #FFD700, 14dp size, 8dp spacing) in a consistent format across the entire app.
   - Featured Movie Quote Card: The Discover page displays a daily featured movie card with a short, punchy movie quote. The featured card first attempts to fetch a quote from the TMDB tagline service via `/api/quotes`, caching positive responses for 6 hours. If the backend API returns 404 (no tagline found) or the request fails, the **frontend** falls back to a local offline catalog of ~1,050 curated movie-themed taglines that are rotated deterministically (day-of-year plus refresh offset). The rotation first attempts to match the quote to a movie already in the recommendation list, then falls back to a TMDB title search. If no metadata can be resolved, the UI keeps the previous selection and shows a concise movie-themed fallback message instead.
   - Trending Movies: When users have no ranked movies, the Discover page displays trending movies from TMDB (weekly trending) instead of an empty state. This provides new users with popular movie suggestions to start their ranking journey.
   - Navigation: Discover is now the first tab in the bottom navigation and the default landing page after authentication, prioritizing movie discovery. Navigation order: Discover → Ranking → Feed → Friends → Profile.
   - Trailer Playback: Movie detail sheets on the Discover page show a play button overlay on the poster when a trailer is available. Clicking the play button opens the trailer in a 9:16 popup window using WebView to load the YouTube mobile page. The popup includes a close button (X) in the top-right corner and supports manual fullscreen toggling via YouTube's native controls.
   - Add to Ranking: Users can add movies to their rankings directly from the Discover page movie detail sheet, triggering the interactive comparison flow inline without navigation. Feedback messages display at the top of the screen overlaying the current page and auto-dismiss after 4 seconds. 

6. Watchlist - Users can save movies to a personal watchlist (e.g., from the Feed detail). The watchlist is visible on the user's Profile (with a "View All" page) and friends can view each other's watchlists from the friend profile page.
   - Watchlist-Ranking Synchronization: Movies are automatically removed from the watchlist when added to rankings. This ensures the watchlist only contains unwatched movies.
   - Sorting: Date added (Newest/Oldest) and Rating (High→Low / Low→High).
   - Display: Each item shows year and 5-star rating display (e.g., "2023 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 8.4" with partial star fill based on TMDB rating converted from 0-10 to 0-5 scale) above the description. Star rating uses gold color (#FFD700), 14dp star size, and 8dp spacing. This format is consistent across Profile watchlist preview, Friends profile watchlist, and Watchlist screen.
   - Where to Watch: Feed preview shows an inline availability line limited to the top 4 platforms (adds " …" if more). Feed detail's "Where to Watch" opens the TMDB watch link. Watchlist and Friend Profile show availability on button press. Country is detected from device locale with CA fallback. Availability text uses the grey on-surface-variant tone.

### **3.2. Use Case Diagram**

![UML diagram](images/UML.png)

### **3.3. Actors Description**

1. User - The User will be the main actor of our app. They will create an account, login, add friends, rank movies and view recommendation lists. 
2. Google Auth API - This will be the external actor which will handle all the sign ins and sign ups. 
3. TMDB API - The TMDB API will provide the movie details and recommendations for movies. This is also an external actor. 


### **3.4. Use Case Description**

- **Use cases for feature 1: Authentication**

1. Sign In : When a user has already created their account, they can just sign in with their google account.
2. Sign Up: All new users will use the Sign Up use case to create an account.
3. Delete Account: When  a user wants to delete an account.
4. Sign Out: When a user wants to sign out of the app, they can use the sign out use case.
5. Edit Profile: Users can edit their display name from the Profile screen. Changes are saved to the backend via PUT /api/users/profile and persisted locally in DataStore. Profile pictures are automatically set from Google account during sign-up.

- **Use cases for feature 2: Manage Friend**
 
1. Send Friend Request: Users send friend requests to other users by entering their email or selecting from search results (name/email). Users receive in-app feedback on success/failure.
2. Accept Friend Request: To accept friend requests received by the user.
3. Reject Friend Request : To reject a friend request received by the user. 
4. Remove Friend: To remove a friend who is a friend of the user. 
5. Search Users: Users can search for other users by name or email to send requests.
6. Cancel Outgoing Request: Users can cancel pending outgoing friend requests.

Design notes:
- Real-time events are delivered via HTTP Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream from the backend. Clients connect to `/api/friends/stream` and receive events for `friend_request`, `friend_request_accepted`, `friend_request_rejected`, and `friend_removed`.
- Additional event: `friend_request_canceled` notifies receivers when a pending request is canceled by the sender.
- Basic rate limiting is enforced for sending friend requests to reduce spam (fixed window, max 5/min per user).
- Client behavior: SSE connection uses infinite read timeout with reconnection/backoff to remain stable during idle periods; UI provides immediate in-app feedback (snackbars) for all friend actions.

- **Use cases for feature 3: Feed**

1. View Feed: The user can view all their friends' activities in their feed. 
2. View Live Update Notification: Every time a friend ranks a movie, a push notification will be received by the user. 
3. Open Movie Detail from Feed: The user taps a feed entry to open a detail sheet with poster/description and can add the movie to their Watchlist or Rankings (with confirmation messages).

- **Use cases for feature 4: Ranked Movie List**

1. Search a Movie: Users can search names of a movie by using the Search Movie use case.
2. Add a Movie: Users can add a movie to their ranked lists.
3. Compare Movies: To rank a movie users must compare the movie with some other movies they have already ranked for the system to generate an accurate ranking of the movie.
4. View Ranking List: The users can view their ranked movie list.
5. Manage Ranking Entry: Tap a ranking card to open an action sheet for managing entries.
   - Rerank: Start the comparison flow using an adjacent movie as the initial comparator.
   - Delete: Remove the movie (requires confirmation), shifts lower ranks up by one.


- **Use cases for feature 5: Discover (Recommendation)**

1. View Recommended Movie List: The user can view a list of recommended movies that the application suggests based on their previously ranked movies.
2. View Trending Movies: When users have no ranked movies, the system displays trending movies from TMDB to help them discover popular films and start their ranking journey.
3. Refresh Recommendations: Users can refresh the recommendation list to see different movie suggestions. The system uses randomized algorithms to provide variety on each refresh while still maintaining relevance based on user rankings.
4. View Movie Trailer: Users can watch movie trailers directly within the app. Tapping the play button on a movie's detail sheet opens the trailer in a popup WebView player that loads the YouTube mobile page. Users can manually toggle fullscreen using YouTube's native controls and close the popup using the X button.
5. Add Movie from Discover: Users can add movies to their rankings directly from the Discover page without navigation. The comparison flow appears inline on the same page.

- **Use cases for feature 6: Watchlist**

1. Add Movie to Watchlist: Users can add movies to their watchlist from the Discover page, Feed, or Search results. The system checks for duplicates and enriches missing metadata (poster, overview) from TMDB API before saving.
2. View Watchlist: Users can view their complete watchlist sorted by date added (newest/oldest) or rating (high/low). Each entry displays the movie poster, title, release year, rating, and overview.
3. Remove Movie from Watchlist: Users can long-press a watchlist item to open a delete confirmation dialog. Upon confirmation, the movie is removed from the watchlist.
4. Sort Watchlist: Users can sort their watchlist by Date Added (Newest/Oldest) or Rating (High→Low/Low→High) via the top-right menu.
5. Add to Ranking from Watchlist: Users can add movies from their watchlist directly to their ranked list. This triggers the comparison flow, and upon successful ranking, the movie is automatically removed from the watchlist.
6. View Watch Providers: Users can tap "Where to Watch" on any watchlist item to open the TMDB watch page or view available streaming services (flatrate/rent/buy) based on their location (country code from device GPS).
7. View Friend's Watchlist: Users can view their friends' watchlists from the friend profile page.

1. **[Ranking Performance]**
   - **Description**: Comparative ranking interactions (selecting between two movies) should update the user’s tier list in under 1 second.
   - **Justification**: The comparative ranking feature is the core interaction of MovieTier. If it feels sluggish, the entire app experience suffers. Keeping the update time under 1 second ensures the interaction feels immediate and engaging, which is critical for usability and user retention. We derived this number from this [study](https://www.uptrends.com/blog/the-psychology-of-web-performance).
2. **[Recommendation List]**
   - **Description**: Any core task (signing in, rating a movie, viewing the feed) should be achievable within 3 clicks/taps.
   - **Justification**: The fewer steps users have to make, the smoother and more intuitive their experience feels. According to [Impact of number of clicks on user experience](https://medium.com/@gizemkorpinar/impact-of-click-number-on-user-experience-fab78e1f2a91) (Gizem Korpinar), fewer clicks tend to correlate with higher perceived usability: “the fewer clicks required to achieve a user’s goal, the greater the usability.”  Users often abandon journeys when they perceive they’re clicking too much. While the “3-click rule” isn’t a hard law and some debate its strict applicability, it works well as a guideline for core tasks.

- `Comment` (Mongoose model) - fields: `userId`, `activityId`, `text`, timestamps; index: `(activityId, createdAt)` for ordered queries.

Feed activities also trigger Firebase Cloud Messaging when a friend likes or comments on your ranking. The SSE stream emits an initial `connected` heartbeat followed by event types such as `feed_activity` to coordinate real-time UI updates, while FCM ensures mobile notifications are delivered if the app is backgrounded.

#### 5. **Watchlist Manager**

**Purpose**: Manages user's movie watchlist with automatic synchronization to remove movies when added to rankings.

**HTTP/REST Interfaces:**
- `GET /api/watchlist`

### **4.2. Databases**



1. **UserDB**
   - **Purpose**: MongoDB cluster that stores all application data (users, ranked movies, friends, notifications, feed, watchlists).
   - **Collections of note**:
     - `users`: Google auth metadata, profile info, `fcmToken`.
     - `feedactivities`: Friend ranking events with references to `users` and TMDB movie metadata.
     - `likes`: New collection for feed engagement. Fields: `_id`, `userId`, `activityId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. Indexes: unique compound `(userId, activityId)` to prevent duplicate likes, and single-field `(activityId)` to support aggregation when returning like counts.
     - `comments`: New collection for feed discussions. Fields: `_id`, `userId`, `activityId`, `text`, timestamps. Index `(activityId, createdAt)` enables chronological pagination. Validation enforces 1–500 character messages.
     - `rankedmovies`, `watchlists`, `friendships`, `friendrequests`, `notifications`: existing collections unchanged by this iteration.

### **4.3. External Modules**

1. **Google Auth API**
   - **Purpose**: Authorize sign in and sign ups of users into the application
2. **TMDB API**
   - **Purpose**: Fetch related movies to generate recommended movie lists, respond to the search movies and movie related information. Also provides movie video/trailer data (via `/movie/{id}/videos` endpoint) for in-app trailer playback, and watch provider information for "Where to Watch" features.
3. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
   - **Purpose**: Send real-time push notifications to users for:
     - Feed updates when friends rank new movies
     - Incoming friend requests
     - Friend request acceptances
   - **Implementation**: Firebase Admin SDK on backend, Firebase Messaging SDK on Android frontend. Device tokens are registered via `/api/users/fcm-token` endpoint and stored in User model.
4. **TMDB Taglines (Quote Sourcing)**
   - **Purpose**: The backend provides `/api/quotes` endpoint which attempts to fetch movie taglines from TMDB via tmdbTaglineService. If TMDB has no tagline for the requested movie, the endpoint returns 404. The Android app implements client-side fallback: when the backend returns 404 or error, the frontend uses its embedded offline catalog of ~1,050 curated movie-themed taglines for display.

### **4.5. Dependencies Diagram**
![dependencies diagram](images/DependencyDiagram.png)

### **4.6. Sequence Diagrams for Major Use Cases**

The following sequence diagrams illustrate how the main components interact to realize the 5 most major use cases.

#### **4.6.1. Use Case 6: Add Movie to Watchlist**

#### **4.6.2. Use Case 2: Send Friend Request**

#### **4.6.3. Use Case 3: View Feed**

#### **4.6.4. Use Case 4: Compare Movies**

#### **4.6.5. Use Case 5: View Recommended Movie List**

### **4.7. Non-Functional Requirements Implementation**

This section describes how each non-functional requirement (defined in section 3.7) is realized in the implementation.

#### **4.7.1. NFR 1: Ranking Performance**

**Requirement**: Comparative ranking interactions (selecting between two movies) should update the user's tier list in under 1 second.

**Implementation**:
The binary comparison algorithm uses an in-memory Map keyed by userId to track active sessions. When a user adds a movie via `POST /api/movies/add`, the backend records the new movie details plus the current search window (`low`/`high` indices). Each comparison (`POST /api/movies/compare`) adjusts those bounds and fetches only a single comparator document. Sessions are cleared as soon as a movie is inserted or rerank completes; there is no background TTL watcher, keeping the logic simple and fast. Database writes (saving the RankedMovie document, creating FeedActivity, and notifying friends) occur only once per movie. MongoDB indexing on `(userId, rank)` ensures O(log n) lookup performance. The entire comparison flow typically completes in 2-4 comparisons for lists of 10-20 movies, with each round-trip taking 100-300ms on average (tested on development environment), well under the 1-second requirement.

#### **4.7.2. NFR 2: Usability - Minimal Click Depth**

**Requirement**: Any core task (signing in, rating a movie, viewing the feed) should be achievable within 3 clicks/taps.

**Implementation**:
The navigation architecture is designed with flat hierarchies and minimal modal interactions to meet the 3-click constraint:

1. **Sign In**:
   - Click 1: Tap "Sign In with Google" on authentication screen
   - Click 2: Select Google account from Credential Manager bottom sheet
   - Result: User is authenticated and navigated to Discover page (2 clicks)

2. **Rating a Movie**:
   - Click 1: Tap search icon on Ranking tab
   - Click 2: Search and select movie from results
   - Click 3: Complete comparison flow (multiple comparisons count as single interaction from UX perspective, presented in modal dialog)
   - Result: Movie is ranked (3 clicks, comparisons are inline interactions)

3. **Viewing the Feed**:
   - Click 1: Tap Feed icon in bottom navigation
   - Result: Feed is displayed with friend activities (1 click)

Additional optimizations include: Bottom navigation for one-tap access to all major features (Discover, Ranking, Feed, Friends, Profile); inline actions using bottom sheets instead of separate screens (e.g., movie details, ranking actions); persistent authentication state via DataStore to skip sign-in on subsequent app launches; real-time SSE updates eliminating need for manual refresh taps. The "Add to Ranking" feature from Discover page further reduces clicks by eliminating navigation between discovery and ranking workflows.
