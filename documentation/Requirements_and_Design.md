## 2. Project Description

MovieTier is a social movie companion app that makes discovering, ranking, and sharing films fun and interactive. On this app, users can login and see what movie their friends have currently rated, themselves can rate a new movie, and get a list of recommended movies based on the movies they have recommended.
In this app instead of giving out boring stars to rate a movie, the user decides which movie they liked more in a head-to-head matchup (comparing the new movie to a movie they have previously ranked), and then the app calculates the rank of the movie automatically . Over time, their personal tier list is built automatically, reflecting their true taste in cinema.
